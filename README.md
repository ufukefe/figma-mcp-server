# Figma Model Context protocol server

## Usage

### STDIO Transport (standard input output)

1. Configure MCP server in your client
```
"Figma": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@antonytm/figma-mcp-server@latest"]
}
```
2. Open Figma file in Figma MCP plugin
3. Plugin should show you message: *Connected to MCP server*
4. You are ready to use MCP server in your client

### Streamable HTTP Transport
Figma MCP server could be run using two types of transport: `stdio` and `streamable-http`. It is configured via environment variable `TRANSPORT`.

1. Start MCP server in terminal
a. Windows CMD: `set TRANSPORT=streamable-http&&npx @antonytm/figma-mcp-server@latest`
b. Windows PowerShell: `$env:TRANSPORT = "streamable-http"; npx @antonytm/figma-mcp-server@latest`
c. macOS Bash: `TRANSPORT=streamable-http npx @antonytm/figma-mcp-server@latest`
2. Open `http://localhost:38450/mcp` in browser. Expected result: `Invalid or missing session ID`
3. Open Figma file in Figma MCP plugin
4. Plugin should show you message: *Connected to MCP server*
5. Configure MCP server in your client
```
"Figma": {
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:38450/mcp"
}
```
6. You should be able to use MCP server

## Development

### MCP server
1. `cd mcp`
2. `npm run dev`

### Plugin
1. `cd plugin`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open Figma
4. Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest ...
5. Select `manifest.json` from `plugin\manifest.json`
6. Start plugin
7. You should see *Connected to MCP server* message

### Inspector
1. `cd mcp`
2. `npm run inspector`
3. Use `http://127.0.0.1:38450/mcp` to connect

## Tools

TBD

## Security

Plugin gives access to your design document for external systems: AI Agents that you will connect. It acts as a bridge in the similar way as the official Figma MCP server. And, similar to the official MCP server it works on local machine and do not expose any information to the networks.

If you want to use it in the network, please do it on your own risk.

If you found any security issue, please report it via GitHub issue. 

## Alternatives

If your tasks could be done by [official Figma MCP server](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Figma-MCP-server), please use it.

Before starting this project, I made a search for my idea to implement Figma MCP server using Figma plugin and sockets as protocol for communication. And I found [this one](https://github.com/grab/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp). Initially, I thought to fork it and change for my needs. But, there are few things that I don't like: requirement to run separate server for socket, everything located in one file, very hard to maintain, JavaScript(not TypeScript or Python). But, you always can consider that server as an alternative.
